# workflows

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows.

## Available actions

## auto-merge

The `auto-merge` reusable action is located in `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`. To use it you will need a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the following scopes:

- `repo` for private repositories
- `public_repo` for public repositories

In the repository that will call this action, you need to [define a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `GH_TOKEN` with the value of your Personal Access Token.

This reusable action depends on the following actions:

- [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
- [dependabot-auto-merge](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependabot-auto-merge)

### Inputs
### Required inputs

#### target-repo

Specify the target repository this action should run on. This is used to prevent actions from running on repositories other than the target repository. For example, specifying a `target-repo` of `mdn/workflows` will prevent the action from running on `fork/workflows`.

- This `input` is required
### Optional inputs

The action has the following optional inputs:

#### auto-approve

Automatically approve pull-requests.

- This `input` is optional with a default of `true`.

#### command

The command to pass to Dependabot.

- This `input` is optional with a default of `squash and merge`.

#### target

The version comparison target. One off major, minor, or patch.

- This `input` is optional with a default of `minor`.

### Usage

In the repository that will call this action, you will need to add a `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml` file with the following content:

#### With defaults

```yml
name: "auto-merge"
on: [pull_request_target]

jobs:
  auto-merge:
    uses: mdn/workflows/.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml@main

When a rebase is needed, the action will write a comment on the pull request to let the PR author know there are merge conflicts. This can be changed to whatever the repository desires, or left blank if no comment should be added.

- This `input` is optional with a default of `This pull request has merge conflicts that must be resolved before it can be merged.`

### Secrets

This action requires the following secrets to be passed by the caller. These need to be set as [environmental secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) using the calling repositories settings.

This reusable action depends on the following actions:

- [checkout](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout)
- [setup-node](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-node-js-environment)

### Inputs

jobs:
  json-lint:
    uses: mdn/workflows/.github/workflows/json-lint.yml@main
    with:
      target-repo: "mdn/workflows"
```

Above you can see how the [`paths` filter](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore) is being used to specify specific files and file patterns.
