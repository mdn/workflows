# Allo-Allo

The `Allo-Allo` reusable action is located at [`.github/workflows/allo-allo.yml`](https://github.com/mdn/workflows/tree/main/.github/workflows/allo-allo.yml).

This workflow is added to repositories to welcome new contributors and congratulate them on their first successful pull request merge.
You can specify all three inputs or a single input depending on your needs.

This reusable action depends on the following actions:

- [Allo-Allo](https://github.com/mechanical-ink/allo-allo)

## Inputs

### Required inputs

#### target-repo

### Optional inputs

#### issue-welcome

- This `input` is optional.

#### pr-welcome
