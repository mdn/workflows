# welcome-bot

The `welcome-bot` reusable action is located at [`.github/workflows/welcome-bot.yml`](https://github.com/mdn/workflows/tree/main/.github/workflows/welcome-bot.yml).

This workflow is added to repositories to welcome new contributors and congratulate them on their first successful pull request merge.
You can specify all three inputs or a single input depending on your needs.

This reusable action depends on the following actions:

- [welcome-bot](https://github.com/actions/first-interaction)

## Inputs

The action has the following inputs:

### Required inputs

#### target-repo

- This `input` is required.

### Optional inputs

#### issue-welcome

Message to show to a contributor opening their first issue.

- This `input` is optional.

#### pr-welcome

Message to show to a contributor opening their first pull request.

- This `input` is optional.
